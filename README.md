# Yet another password generator script

Just another password generator, probably only useful to myself. Generates a random password using just letters and numbers (no special characters) at a fixed length and copies to clipboard buffer. My workflow includes this being a hotkey in AwesomeWM and allows me to quickly paste random passwords.
